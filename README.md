# design-patterns-scala

This repo includes notes and implemented code examples for "Head First Design Patterns"

The book that I use is [this](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596007126.do). 
To follow the book, it is suggested to have some Java background. And the code examples
are given in Java. As a beginner in both *Design Patterns* and *Scala*, I think
it might be helpful to implement the examples in Scala. So here it is.
